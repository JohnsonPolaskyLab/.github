## Welcome to the GitHub Page of Johnson-Polasky Lab ðŸ‘‹

### About us
The concept of a lab is more central in the physical sciences with expensive shared equipment. But for the collective of researchers who make up the Johnson-Polasky Lab, a lab is more than a place to share resources. Our lab is defined as an interdisciplinary community of scholars brought together by a shared interest in studying natural capital and ecosystem services. Members have diverse backgrounds in fields including applied economics, ecology, biosystems engineering, and natural resource management. 
The Johnson-Polasky Lab supports member growth through the following activities:
* Opportunities for scholars to present research and receive feedback based on the collective inter-disciplinary knowledge of the group.
* Collaborative research efforts, in which Lab members come together to build projects and produce research papers.
* Invited lectures from faculty or others that help expand the knowledge of Lab members.
